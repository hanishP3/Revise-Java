Basic Terminologies in Java
1. Class: The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of an (object). It can be defined as a logical template that share common properties and methods.
Example: Blueprint of the house is class.

2. Object : The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behavior and state.
Example: Dog, Cat, Monkey etc. are the object of “Animal” class.
Behavior: Running on the road.

3. Method : The behavior of an object is the method.
Example : The fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.

4. Instance variables : Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

""objects communicate with each other using methods ""
