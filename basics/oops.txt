1.Object
2.Class
3.Inheritance
4.Polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation

1.Object
An Object is an real world entity such as pen,book,bike etc..
An object is an instance of class.
An object has a state and behavior.
An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory
Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.

2.Class
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space

3.Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

4.Polymorphism
A one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

5.Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.
In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

6.Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation
